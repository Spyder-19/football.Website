        <h1>History of Football</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Football, also known as soccer in some parts of the world, 
            is one of the most popular sports globally. It is a game played by two
            teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. The objective of the game 
            is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Early History</h2>
        <p>
            The origins of football can be traced back to ancient civilizations.
            Various forms of the game existed in different cultures, such as the Chinese
            game of Cuju and the Greek game of Episkyros. However, the modern version of
            football began to take shape in England during the 19th century.

        <h2>The Birth of Modern Football</h2>
        <p>
            The establishment of the Football Association (FA) in 1863 in England marked the 
            official start of modern football. The FA standardized the rules, separating it from 
            rugby football. The first official football match under these rules was played in 1863 between two London teams.
